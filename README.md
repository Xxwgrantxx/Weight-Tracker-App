Approach

- Feature Analysis: Identified key functionalities based on user needs.
- UI Design: Brainstormed and created wireframes for an intuitive user experience.
- Development: Implemented core screens and functionalities while testing iteratively.

Testing Strategy
To ensure a seamless user experience:

- Utilized IDE tools like debugging and unit tests.
- Conducted hands-on testing with an IDE emulator.
- Deployed the APK on a personal device for real-world testing.
- Example bug fix: Adjusted text color in input fields for better visibility.

Challenges
One of the most significant hurdles was managing user profile data securely. Separating profile-specific information required revisiting database concepts to ensure:

- Accurate data retrieval during login.
- Restricted access to prevent viewing others' data.

I am most proud of the Main Screen:
- Leveraged floating action buttons, text, and image components effectively.
- Implemented scrolling for off-screen data display.
- Added dynamic button behavior based on user input criteria.
