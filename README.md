# Weight Tracker App
The weight tracker app is a system designed to give users the ability to define a goal weight and track their progress towards that goal weight.
Neccessary features:

To meet the user’s needs, several screens were required. There needed to be screens to add/update a goal weight, add/up daily weights, and a screen to view the history of weights added. To give the user more flexibility when it comes to keeping taps on being close to their goal weight, there is also a feature added to alert the user once they have reached their goal weight. Each user is also able to create their own account to ensure data security.

Approach/Strategy:

I first determined the features required to meet user needs. I then brainstormed on a user interface that portraited these features. After brainstorming, I designed a simple wireframe for the user interface. Once I felt comfortable with these areas, I moved to coding the main screens along with their functionality, testing as I progressed.

Testing strategy and its importance:
I began by utilizing IDE features such as debugging, and unit tests. I also used the IDE modulator to get some hands on and get a feel for the application. When no further bugs or issues were discovered, I built the APK and tested the application on my personal device. The step is extremely important because it allows developers to remove any hidden bugs. Bugs that would damage user experience prevent future business. A fitting example if this is that it wasn’t until I ran the app on my personal device that I noticed the input fields had white text. If this bug remained, a user would not be able to see the data typed in the text boxes.
Challenges:
The entire development process posed so many challenges, however the area that took a huge amount of effort was separating profile data. I needed a major refresher in databases to ensure the app not only pulled the right profile data for login, but also to ensure a user did not have access to another user’s data.
Demonstration of knowledge, skills, and experience?
I am most proud of the main screen. I was able to display knowledge in the utilization of the floating action button, text, and image components, scrolling when data was displayed off screen, and disabling buttons when a criterion is not met.
